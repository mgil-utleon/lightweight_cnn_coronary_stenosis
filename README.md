# Hybrid-Evolutionary Multi-Objective Method for Automatic Design of Lightweight CNN Architecture applied to Coronary Stenosis Classification

This repository contains the Matlab code *ready to run* of
a Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) focused in the 
classification of positive and negative coronary stenosis cases.

The CNN model is as follows:
